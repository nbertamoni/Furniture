# Furniture
This is a furniture I am designing to my living room. It is intended to store books, radio and tv stuffs and it is design to fit a my living room, so does not expect to fit in yours.

The desk is not symmetric, the right side and back have ridden space to the cables.

The software I am using to design is FreeCAD 0.21.2

The overall result is good. The possible changes is to make the shelfs better distributed to the opening doors.

## Conclusion and tips to the next furnitute project:
- Start with a paper draft as done, but worry later in CAD with minor details;
- Build the first CAD project and check all the resources available, the resources will say if project changes are needed;
- Start with the base support and backs as done, but do an assembly ordered list. The Gantt chart may be useful.
