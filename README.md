# Furniture
This is a furniture I am designing to my living room. It is intended to store books, radio and tv stuffs and it is design to fit a my living room, so does not expect to fit in yours.

The desk is not symmetric, the right side and back have ridden space to the cables.

The software I am using to design is FreeCAD 0.21.2
